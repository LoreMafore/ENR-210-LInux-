Problem 1: (5 points)

Suppose you have a camera that names it's images with the word `image' followed by a 10 digit random number, followed by a dash and the date. For example:

image3874319230-160924.jpg

where the 160923 means the image was created on the 16th of September, 2024. 
You don't like the 10 digit random number in there and would rather have the images just named by the date and the file number from that date. So that, 
for example, the file above would be called

160924-1.jpg

and the next one on that same date would be

160924-2.jpg

etc. Write a command line shell script, that uses sed and regex, which will rename all of the .jpg files in the current directory to get rid of the stuff 
you don't want as in the example above.

Write a coin flip game in Bash where the computer is going to flip a coin and the user has to call it heads or tails. Then, make it more interesting by having 
it keep score and report the current score after each flip.
