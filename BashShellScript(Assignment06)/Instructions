Examine the various subdirectories in /sys/class/thermal and the various files found there.

Write a Bash shell script which reads the temperatures of parts of your computer using, for example

 cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/type
 cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
 cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1/type
 cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1/temp
 ...etc...

and sets them to variables named 

type0, temp0, type1, temp1, ...

Then convert the temperatures to Celcius using, for example,

 echo "$temp0/1000" | bc

and set it to a variable named celcius0. (Note that not all of them have to be divided by 1000, you will have to look at the 
numbers and decide which ones need to be divided in order to get Celcius)

The end result should be that a user can execute your script and it will output the different sensor types along with the 
different temperatures in your computer.
