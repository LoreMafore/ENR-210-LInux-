1. Galaxy came up. the .a..x. = galaxy because the . means any character so 
   it brought up the word galaxy because that is the only word with a and x 
   in those positions.

2. Anyword at the begging of a sentence that was repeated came up like: AA or
   bonbon. The \(.*\) represents anyword. And the \1 means that word repeated

3.a. I choose grep '^\(.\+\)\1\(.\+\)\2$' /usr/share/dict/words . It very
     similar to the prvious command. It finds a char at the beginning of 
     a sentence and sees if it appears twice besides each other and then it
     find another charcter and does the same. This results in finding words
     WWII and xxii.

  b. it matches any words that have two paurs of leeters by each other like:
     Walloon

4. This command would match any charcter for the first 3 characters of the 
   sentence. Then the 4th character would be a number between 3-8. Characters
   5 and 6 are any random chacters. Finally charcter number 8 is a Upper case
   letter of the alphabet.

5.  '^d.*d$'


6. awk '{print tolower($0)}' blah.txt > sorted.txt
